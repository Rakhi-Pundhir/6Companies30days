**Q-1 (C1q1)**
***Given an array of strings, return all groups of strings that are anagrams***
To check if two strings are anagrams or not we sort both strings and then compare them, if they are equal they are said to be anagrams else not.
Here we are using maps of STL to optimize our solution that uses nested loops to compare each string with all other strings.
We traverse the string only once and sort each string and this sorted string acts as key of map and values would be the actual string
then we compare other strings with it and if they are anagrams of this string then they will be added as values of this key in the map.
